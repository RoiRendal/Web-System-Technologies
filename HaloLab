Web design and page structure play a big role in encouraging users to
click and scroll. But what if there was a blueprint to ensure that every single
one of your web pages is visitor-friendly? Well, you’re in the right place, as
today we’ll break down 19 essential elements of a successful website and share
insider tips on how to use them properly.
            </p>

            <h3>Why do you need to think about page structure</h3>

            <p>
Let’s start by defining what a webpage is, as it is not the same as a website.
Simply put, it’s an individual page with specific URLs, different content, and
unique images, where every element plays a crucial role in engaging the visitor.
When talking about its structure, we’re addressing how all these pieces fit
together to make something that’s good to look at and makes sense to use.
            </p>

            <p>
The organized webpage is the foundation of your online presence. It’s what
guides your visitors through the content, like invisible signposts pointing to
where they want to go. Without a well-thought-out structure, even the most
visually stunning page can leave users lost and confused, resulting in a higher
bounce rate and lower engagement.
            </p>

            <h3><li>Header</li></h3>

            <p>
First up is the header or a site menu. Sitting right at the top, it is the
primary thing anyone sees, no matter which page they land on. This element is
strategically important, allowing users to jump from one page to the next
without hindrance. It often includes a logo, main navigation, and sometimes a
contact button or social media links.
            </p>

            <p>
Your header is a site guide that ensures visitors know exactly where they are
and how to find what they’re looking for. But here’s the thing — while it
might be tempting to pack the header with as much information as possible,
it’s crucial not to overload it. This approach helps in finding the perfect
balance between providing essential information and maintaining simplicity.
            </p>

            <img src="sample-header.png">
            <h5>A visible and informative header presents a site’s content</h5>

        </section>

        <section>

            <h3><li>CTA button</li></h3>

            <p>
Next on the list is the Call to Action (CTA) buttons that guide your
visitors on what to do next, whether it’s “Buy Now,” “Learn More,” or
“Sign Up.” Their main aim is to turn a passive user into an active one while
improving conversions for a particular page.
            </p>

            <p>
However, it’s not just about slapping a button anywhere. A good CTA subtly
stands out and doesn’t scream for attention — it’s clear, compelling, and
inviting. Placement is key, too. Put it in a spot where it’s easy for visitors
to find, and check out whether it makes sense in the context of your page.
            </p>

            <p>
Remember, the CTA button is your chance to convert a casual visitor into a
customer or subscriber. Though a small element, it packs a powerful punch.
Think of it as the finishing touch that brings the whole page together and
sets the stage for your user’s next step.
            </p>

        <section>

            <h3><li>Hero section</li></h3>

            <p>
Moving on, let’s talk about the hero section. Typically found below the
header, this element is your chance to make an impactful statement. That
section usually combines an eye-catching image or video with a powerful message
and is often complemented by a CTA button. Its purpose is to grab attention,
deliver a key message, and set the tone for the rest of the site.
            </p>

            <p>
This component needs to connect with your visitors immediately, telling them
what your site is about and what they can expect from it. It’s a balancing
act — you want to be bold, captivating, clear and concise. When done right,
the hero section can make the user experience better, drawing people in and
motivating them to explore further.
